### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an open source project demonstrating the modern mobile web.
Video explaining this project here: https://youtu.be/-SIJiZzzuB0. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all things web development. I recently completed Lambda School full-stack web development track.  
ðŸ“« How to reach me: DM me on twitter.com/petedram. 
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about travel and single malt scotch whisky.
